decompil
========

The goal of this toy project is to offer a tool/framework/thing that eases
reverse engineering of assembly code thanks to a "retargetable" decompiler. As
a first architecture, I'm trying to develop a decompiler for the GameCube's DSP
(sound processor).

At the moment, it's still in the early stages: we cannot even talk of a proof
of concept yet! It's almost not commented, things are moving, needless to say
that there is no documentation at all.

I will update this once it can actually be used for something!
